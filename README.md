# üåê Technium

The **technium** is an idea created by Kevin Kelly that explains how all technology works together as one big, growing system. This system includes computers, phones, the internet, companies, and everything people know about technology. All these parts work together and help each other grow, just like how different parts of your body work together. The technium grows by itself - when someone invents something new, it makes it easier to invent even more things.
